Ecommerce Practice — Next.js + Convex + Clerk + Razorpay

Project Overview

This project was built to learn and practice backend integrations using modern full-stack tools.
The focus is on functionality rather than UI — exploring how authentication, database, and payment systems work together inside a real application.

Tech Stack

Next.js 15 (App Router + TypeScript) – Frontend framework

Convex – Backend-as-a-service for database, queries, and mutations

Clerk – Authentication and user management

Zustand – State management for guest cart

Razorpay – Payment gateway integration

Tailwind CSS – Utility-first styling

Core Features

Authentication with Clerk – Login, signup, and role-based access (Admin/User)

Convex Database

Product CRUD

Cart (Add, Remove, Update Quantity, Clear after payment)

Orders (Saved automatically after successful payment)

Razorpay Checkout

Order creation from the frontend

Payment verification on backend

Order details saved in Convex

Zustand Guest Cart – Persistent cart for non-logged-in users, synced to Convex after sign-in

Role-Based Routing – Separate admin and user dashboards

Minimal UI – Clean interface to visualize backend flow
